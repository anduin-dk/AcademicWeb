                  <p>
                  I studied Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Warwick, where I have graduated with an 
                  MMathStat in July 2024. Although my degree was administered by the Department of Statistics, I have 
                  found myself a lot more interested in pure mathematics. During my degree, I have focused on       functional 
                  analysis, elliptic and parabolic PDE theory, differential geometry, harmonic analysis and measure theory.
                  I have also attended some relevant modules without taking them for credit, including Lie groups, Bifurcation theory etc. My masters thesis explores the geometry of embedded hypersurfaces in a quasi-contact sub-Riemannian manifold, where I focused on the local geometry near the characteristic points on such hypersurfaces.
                  I have been applying for a PhD position in Mathematics, where my first attempts during the final year were not 
                  too successful due to the lack of funding (because of my international student status in the UK and the lack of
                  funding for UK-based Maths PhD students in general). Before university, I was living in Germany, attended schools 
                  in Cologne, Gevelsberg, and Dortmund in chronological order.

                  Research interests
                </h1>
                <p>
                  I am broadly interested in geometric analysis, which is the study of problems arising in differential geometry 
                  with analytical methods including a large use of non-linear PDE theory and the calculus of variations. More 
                  specifically, I am currently interested in minimal submanifolds(in particular minimal hypersurfaces), geometric 
                  flows, regularity theory, non-linear PDEs, geometric measure theory and differential geometry in general. Recently, 
                  I have become more interested in the use of GMT and variational methods to tackle geometric problems, starting with 
                  the compactness and regularity theory for varifolds, and the parallel to minimal hypersurfaces in the theory of phase 
                  transitions using the Allen-Cahn energy functional.
                  I also enjoy learning other topics in geometric analysis including regularity theory for harmonic maps, geometric 
                  obstacle problems, metric geometry, analysis on RCD spaces, optimal transport and the synthetic theory for Lorentzian geometry.
